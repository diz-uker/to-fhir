## Development

### Snapshot testing

#### Auto-approve snapshot changes

Usually, approving a changed snapshots requires manually renaming or moving the
snapshot file from `.received.` to `.approved.`.
If you are facing a lot of changed snapshots and are certain that your changes
are valid, you can automatically approve them:

```sh
APPROVAL_TESTS_USE_REPORTER=AutoApproveReporter ./gradlew test
```

Source: <https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java/issues/590>.

You can also run this in a loop to approve indexed snapshots:

```sh
for i in {1..10};
    do APPROVAL_TESTS_USE_REPORTER=AutoApproveReporter ./gradlew test;
done
```
